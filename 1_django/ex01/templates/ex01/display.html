    <h2>Display Process of a Static Page</h2>
    <!-- 1. Client Request -->
    <section id="client-request">
        <h2>1. Client Request</h2>
        <p>The user opens a browser and enters a URL, sending an HTTP GET request to the server.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Server Receives Request -->
    <section id="server-receive">
        <h2>2. Server Receives Request</h2>
        <p>The web server (e.g., NGINX or Apache) receives the request and passes it to the web application via an ASGI/WSGI interface.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Routing -->
    <section id="routing">
        <h2>3. Routing</h2>
        <p>The web framework maps the URL to a specific view function based on routing rules. For example, a URL like <code>/static-page</code> is mapped to a view called <code>static_page_view</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. View Execution -->
    <section id="view-execution">
        <h2>4. View Execution</h2>
        <p>The matched view function, <code>static_page_view</code>, is executed. Since this is a static page, thereâ€™s no need to fetch data from a database.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Template Rendering -->
    <section id="template-rendering">
        <h2>5. Template Rendering</h2>
        <p>The view function calls the template engine to load the HTML template, such as <code>static_page.html</code>, from the templates directory.</p>
        <p>If the template has placeholders, the view may supply optional data in a context dictionary.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. HTTP Response Creation -->
    <section id="http-response">
        <h2>6. HTTP Response Creation</h2>
        <p>The rendered HTML content is wrapped in an HTTP response object, which includes necessary headers and a status code (e.g., <code>200 OK</code>).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 7. Response Sending -->
    <section id="response-sending">
        <h2>7. Response Sending</h2>
        <p>The response is sent back to the client through the application server, where the browser will receive it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- 8. Browser Receives and Renders -->
    <section id="browser-render">
        <h2>8. Browser Receives and Renders</h2>
        <p>The browser receives the HTTP response and renders the HTML content, displaying the static web page to the user.</p>
    </section>
